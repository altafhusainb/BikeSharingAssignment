## General Information
Problem Statement
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes. How well those variables describe the bike demands Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

Business Goal:
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.


## Conclusions
As per the final Model, the top 3 predictor variables that influences the bike booking are:

Temperature (temp) - A coefficient value of ‘0.5683’ indicated that a unit increase in temp variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.5683 units.
Weather Situation 3 (weathersit_3) - A coefficient value of ‘-0.3176’ indicated that, w.r.t Weathersit1, a unit increase in Weathersit3 variable decreases the bike hire numbers by 0.3176 units.
Year (yr) - A coefficient value of ‘0.2316’ indicated that a unit increase in yr variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.2316 units.
